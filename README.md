# Architecture

## Components
- **Backend**: REST API service.
- **Frontend**: Web UI.
- **Ingress**: NGINX ingress controller for routing.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger.

## Flow
- Ingress routes traffic to backend/frontend.
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from ServiceMonitors.
- Grafana visualizes metrics/logs/traces.
- ArgoCD manages deployments via GitOps.
---------

Monitoring: Use Prometheus to collect and store metrics from your application and Kubernetes cluster.
Logging: Use Fluent Bit to collect logs from application pods and forward them to a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch or Loki.
Alerting: Use Prometheus Alertmanager to define and manage alerts based on metrics.
Visualization: Use Grafana to visualize metrics and logs, integrated with Prometheus and the logging backend.
Helm: Package the observability stack as Helm charts for easy deployment and management.
ArgoCD: Manage the deployment of these Helm charts declaratively using GitOps principles.



| **Aspect**              | **Without Docker + NGINX**                                     | **With Docker + NGINX**                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Environment Setup**   | Manual install on server (Node.js, npm, app code)              | Prepackaged image — runs anywhere Docker runs                       |
| **Reproducibility**     | Risk of “works on my machine, not on server”                   | Identical environment across dev, test, prod                        |
| **Deployment Process**  | Manual build + deploy steps, error-prone                       | Build once, ship Docker image, deploy consistently                  |
| **Scaling Up**          | Manual setup for each instance                                 | Easily run multiple container replicas (docker-compose, Kubernetes) |
| **Rollback**            | Must manually revert files/configs                             | Roll back to previous Docker image instantly                        |
| **Static File Serving** | Maybe rely on `ng serve` or raw file server                    | NGINX optimized for static assets                                   |
| **Compression**         | Likely missing, slower load                                    | Gzip compression by NGINX                                           |
| **Caching**             | No long-term asset caching                                     | 30-day caching for JS, CSS, images (faster repeat loads)            |
| **SPA Routing**         | Refresh on Angular routes causes 404                           | Handled by NGINX with `try_files /index.html` fallback              |
| **Security Headers**    | Must add manually (if remembered)                              | Predefined secure headers in nginx.conf                             |
| **Concurrent Requests** | Weak handling under high load (`ng serve` not designed for it) | NGINX handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently       |
| **CI/CD Integration**   | Custom scripts per environment                                 | Standardized Docker-based pipelines                                 |
| **Portability**         | Tightly coupled to the specific server setup                   | Portable across any machine/cloud supporting Docker                 |



TODO
1. Create DB (MongoDB) related pod and use it in our project
Currently, you’re using MongoDB Atlas, but for a production-ready setup, hosting MongoDB in your Kubernetes cluster ensures better control, cost management, and integration with your existing setup. This should be the first step to establish a self-managed database.
2. Use Loki for log management
Since you’ve already started integrating Loki in your dev namespace (as seen in infra/config/dev/monitoring/loki/), setting up log management next ensures you can monitor and debug your application effectively as you make changes.
3. Use Grafana and Prometheus (clarify Grafana vs. Grafana Tempo)
Prometheus is ideal for metrics collection and alerting, and Grafana for visualization. Grafana Tempo is for distributed tracing, which isn’t a priority yet since you haven’t mentioned tracing needs. We’ll set up Grafana with Prometheus for metrics monitoring, as it aligns with your existing setup.
4. Use SLO for alert
Once metrics are in place with Prometheus and Grafana, you can define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and set up alerts to ensure your application meets reliability goals. This builds on the previous step.
5. Use Terraform
Terraform can be used to manage your infrastructure as code (e.g., Kubernetes cluster, AWS resources). This comes after setting up core observability, as it’s more about infrastructure automation.
6. Use AWS services
Finally, integrating AWS services (e.g., EKS for Kubernetes, S3 for storage) can enhance scalability and reliability. This is the last step since it may involve migrating or enhancing your existing setup.
