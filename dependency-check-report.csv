It uses prototype pollution against `Array::forEach` to extract `__webpack_require__` reference.  ### Impact This vulnerability can result in the source code to be stolen for users that uses a predictable port and output path for the entrypoint script.  <details> <summary>Old content</summary>  ### Summary Source code may be stolen when you use [`output.iife: false`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputiife) and access a malicious web site.  ### Details When `output.iife: false` is set, some global variables for the webpack runtime are declared on the `window` object (e.g. `__webpack_modules__`). Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject `<script src=""http://localhost:8080/main.js"">` in their site and run the script. Note that the attacker has to know the port and the output entrypoint script path. By running that, the webpack runtime variables will be declared on the `window` object. By using `Function::toString` against the values in `__webpack_modules__`, the attacker can get the source code.  I pointed out `output.iife: false`, but if there are other options that makes the webpack runtime variables to be declared on the `window` object, the same will apply for those cases.  ### PoC 1.
