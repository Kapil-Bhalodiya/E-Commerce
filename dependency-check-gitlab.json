Note that the attacker has to know the port and the output entrypoint script path. By running that, the webpack runtime variables will be declared on the `window` object.\nBy using `Function::toString` against the values in `__webpack_modules__`, the attacker can get the source code.\n\nI pointed out `output.iife: false`, but if there are other options that makes the webpack runtime variables to be declared on the `window` object, the same will apply for those cases.\n\n### PoC\n1.
